    /// This volume type has a few different modes, each with its own characteristics:
    /// 
    /// Local Persistent Volumes are stored on worker node local disks but managed
    /// in a way that preserves the data even if the container using them is removed.
    /// These volumes offer excellent performance due to their local nature but are
    /// tied to a specific node. If that node fails, the volume becomes unavailable
    /// until the node recovers. This approach is suitable for workloads that
    /// prioritize performance over availability, or in clusters where node failures
    /// are rare.
    /// 
    /// Network-Attached Volumes are implemented via network storage protocols such
    /// as NFS, iSCSI, or specialized storage vendor APIs. These volumes can be
    /// accessed from any node in the cluster, allowing containers to be rescheduled
    /// freely without losing access to their data. The tradeoff is increased latency
    /// due to network communication, though modern networks and storage protocols can
    /// minimize this impact. Network-attached volumes are ideal for workloads that
    /// require flexibility in placement and moderate performance.
    /// 
    /// Distributed Volumes are spread across multiple physical nodes for redundancy
    /// and improved availability. Technologies like Ceph, GlusterFS, or Longhorn
    /// underpin these volumes, storing multiple copies of the data or using erasure
    /// coding to protect against node failures. Distributed volumes offer the best
    /// combination of availability and performance, though they typically require
    /// more resources due to the replication overhead. They're well-suited for
    /// mission-critical applications where both performance and reliability are
    /// important.
    Persistent(PersistentVolume),
    /// Represents a network-shared volume
    /// 
    /// This volume type is used for applications that require data to be shared
    /// across app instances running on different nodes in the cluster, and for applications
